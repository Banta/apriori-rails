Apriori C code by Christian Borgelt. Taken directly from: todo, url

overview:
  apriori/     - christian's apriori code (i'm currently debugging it for ruby purposes, but it will eventually be all the original)
  math/, util/ - christian's supporting code
  swig/        - my initial attempt at a swig wrapper, it doesnt work at all
  ruby/
    - test/    - a "hello world" of ruby c extensions
    - apriori  - this is where most of my work is

So to try it out:

  cd ruby/apriori
  rake get_it_done 

This will build the extension and run the "test"
